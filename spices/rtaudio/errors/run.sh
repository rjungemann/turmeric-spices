# errors/run.sh -- assert the rtaudio compile-fail diagnostics.
#
# These are compile-FAIL fixtures: each must be REJECTED, for a specific
# reason. That is the inverse of every other test in the spice, so they
# live outside tests/ -- `tur test tests` recurses, and counted each of
# these as a suite failure, which made this spice's CI job red on this
# directory alone while the real tests passed.
#
# Relocating them fixes the red job. This script is the other half: it
# asserts each fixture fails for the RIGHT reason. Checking only "does not
# compile" lets a fixture silently drift onto an unrelated diagnostic and
# stop testing its subject. So every assertion pins a witness substring
# that only the intended defect produces -- the code alone is too coarse,
# since TUR-E0001 / TUR-E0100 / TUR-E0101 each cover several fixtures here
# for unrelated reasons.
#
# ci.yml runs this via its "Assert compile-fail diagnostics" step, which is
# a no-op for any spice without an executable errors/run.sh.
#
# Usage: errors/run.sh [path/to/tur]
